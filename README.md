## Usage

0. place your video into `./outputs` folder. (I've prepared a test video).

##### Single person video

1. change the `video_path` in the `./videopose.py`
2. Run it! You will find the rendered output video in the `./outputs` folder.

##### Multiple person video (Not implemented yet)

1. For developing, check `./videopose_multi_person`

   ```python
   video = 'kobe.mp4'
   
   handle_video(f'outputs/{video}') 
   # Run AlphaPose, save the result into ./outputs/alpha_pose_kobe
   
   track(video)					 
   # Taking the result from above as the input of PoseTrack, output poseflow-results.json # into the same directory of above. 
   # The visualization result is save in ./outputs/alpha_pose_kobe/poseflow-vis
   
   # TODO: Need more action:
   #  1. "Improve the accuracy of tracking algorithm" or "Doing specific post processing 
   #     after getting the track result".
   #  2. Choosing person(remove the other 2d points for each frame)
   ```
## Google Colab Usage 

0. Open the .ipynb file in the repo with colab.

1. place your video into `./outputs` folder.

##### Single person video

2. change the `video_path` in the `./videopose.py`
3. Run it! You will find the rendered output video in the `./outputs` folder.

##### Multiple person video 

1. For developing, check `./videopose_multi_person`

   ```python
   video = 'kobe.mp4'
   
   handle_video(f'outputs/{video}') 
   # Run AlphaPose, save the result into ./outputs/alpha_pose_kobe
   
   track(video)					 
   # Taking the result from above as the input of PoseTrack, output poseflow-results.json # into the same directory of above. 
   # The visualization result is save in ./outputs/alpha_pose_kobe/poseflow-vis
   
   # TODO: Need more action:
   #  1. "Improve the accuracy of tracking algorithm" or "Doing specific post processing 
   #     after getting the track result".
   #  2. Choosing person(remove the other 2d points for each frame)

The 2D pose to 3D pose and visualization part is from [VideoPose3D](https://github.com/facebookresearch/VideoPose3D).

Some of the "In the wild" script is adapted from the other [fork](https://github.com/tobiascz/VideoPose3D).

The project structure and `./videopose.py` running script is adapted from [this repo](https://github.com/lxy5513/videopose).

I got from its great integration and expression [this repo](https://github.com/zh-plus/video-to-pose3D).
